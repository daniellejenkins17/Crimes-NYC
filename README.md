 Time Series Analysis of Crimes in NYC 
 
 I have created a dataframe of the different crimes in NYC, particularly looking at the subway crimes 
 
 Creating a map of the subway crimes, we can see where previous activity has occurred. 
 
 With a time series analysis, we can see where crimes are most likely to occur and which types of crimes are likely to occur in which areas.
